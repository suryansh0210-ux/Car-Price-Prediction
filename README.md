**Car-Price-Prediction**
A manchine learning project of used car price prediction based on car age and mileage.
📘Overview
This is a simple Machine Learning project that predicts the selling price of a used car using Linear Regression.  
It automatically creates a small dataset of 50 cars with details like car age and mileage, then trains a model to understand how these factors affect price.  
No external file or dataset is required — everything runs inside the program itself

⚙️ How It Works
1. The program creates  car data automatically.  
2. Each car has:
   - 🚘 Car Age (in years)
   - ⛽ Mileage (in km/l)
   - 💰 Selling Price (in lakhs)
3. The model uses Linear Regression to learn the relation between car features and price.  
4. It tests the model on unseen data to measure accuracy (~95%).  
5. Finally, it predicts the price of a new car (e.g., 4 years old, 22 km/l mileage).
